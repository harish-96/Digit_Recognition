## Synopsis

Given an image containing handwritten numbers, this package segments the image and identifies each digit present in the image.
Shortly, a handwritten digit recognizing software(a very crude one though).

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

This project has started as part of course on Python. We(Harish and Surya) formed a team and started thinking of ideas then we thought of handwritten digit recognition software using neural networks

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
